# SmartVolume

This proyect is about change the device volume according to the input speed.

The idea is to update the music volume according to the speed of your motorcicle. Because when you are riding fast a motorcicle with a bluetooth helmet, the air noise doesn't let you hear anything. If you set the volume too high, it can bother you when you are riding slow.

So the APP will set the volume according to the motorcicle speed :)
